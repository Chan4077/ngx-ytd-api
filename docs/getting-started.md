# Getting started

For help getting started with a new Angular app, check out the [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io).

For existing apps, follow the steps bellow to begin using `ngx-ytd-api`!

## Step 1. Configuring an app to enable YouTube Data API

Follow [these steps](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started#before-you-start) to setup an app to use the YouTube Data API. Once you're done, head back here.

## Step 2. Install the library

Install the latest version (`1.0.0-alpha.3`) by running this command:

### NPM v5 and above

```bash
npm i ngx-ytd-api
```

### NPM v4 and below

```bash
npm i --save ngx-ytd-api
```

### Alternative: Snapshot builds

Alternatively, you can install snapshot builds which are built for every commit and published to `https://github.com/Chan4077/ngx-ytd-api-builds`. Take note that these builds may be experimental and may break your app.

#### NPM v5 and above

```bash
npm i Chan4077/ngx-ytd-api-builds
```

#### NPM v4 and below

```bash
npm i --save Chan4077/ngx-ytd-api-builds
```

That's it! For documentation on a submodule, see the individual `README.md` in the specified submodule.
